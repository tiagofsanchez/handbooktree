# Handbooktree

The new platform for hosts (airbnb or any other platform really) to share guides and valuable things to do once guests book their stay.

Ever hosted guests for short-term stays? You know the drill—explaining house rules, giving local tips—it can be a bit of a hassle, right? Well, that's where HandbookTree swoops in. Picture this: you upload your listing rules and insider guides, and voilà! Your guests get a smooth, stress-free experience. Because hey, the stay itself? That's what makes or breaks it. HandbookTree: making hosting a breeze!
